## Overview
VICSR (Vocabulary In Context + Spaced Repetition) is a cross-platform mobile app intended for language students, medical/premed students, or any student in a discipline which is vocabulary-dense. The app will help students by teaching the user foreign language or special subject vocabulary words in the most scientifically sound manner. 

VISCR facilitates foreign language and special subject vocabulary learning in two ways: by making vocabulary and translations available in the context of assigned texts, and by organizing said vocabulary into flash cards, which are presented to the user using the principles of spaced-repetition learning. Unlike competitors such as Notability, Anki, and Quizlet, VICSR streamlines the “reading to vocabulary learning pipeline” by bundling useful and novel functionality in one app! No other app lets a user simply highlight a word to translate it, let alone automatically begin teaching the user said word via a scientifically sound studying methodology.
