### Vocabulary In Context + Spaced Repitition

## Overview
VICSR - or Vocabulary In Context + Spaced Repetition is a vocabulary learning app. By enabling learners to see new vocabulary words in the context of their reading using our intuitive highlight to translation feature, memorization starts early. When the user finishes a reading, they can easily begin to memorize all the unknown new words by taking advantage  of VICSRâ€™s automatic flashcard generation feature. Any word highlighted in a given document (and its translation) will be appended to a flashcard deck, from which users can study their new vocabulary.
