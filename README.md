# VICSR
### Vocabulary In Context + Spaced Repitition

## Overview
VISCR facilitates foreign language and special subject vocabulary learning in two ways: by making user highlighted vocabulary and translations available in the context of assigned texts as a sidebar, and by organizing said vocabulary into flash cards, which the user studies using the principles of spaced-repetition learning. Unlike competitors such as Notability, Anki, and Quizlet, VICSR streamlines the “reading to vocabulary learning pipeline” by bundling useful and novel functionality in one app! No other app lets a user simply highlight a word to translate it, let alone automatically transposing this vocab pair into a flash card for easy studying!

In conclusion, VICSR is for students and learners who want to study vocabulary using the most effective method. It provides a way to extract and define vocabulary in the context of the text itself, and study said vocabulary with automatically generated flash cards and study plans. Unlike products such as Anki, Notability, Evernote, Quizlet, Bear, and analog flashcards, our product combines useful and novel functionality to simplify the “reading to studying pipeline” and save users’ time.
