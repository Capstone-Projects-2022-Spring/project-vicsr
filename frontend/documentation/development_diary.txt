Entry 1 - Mar 8
- Using this page to help implement navigation through the app https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation#react-navigation
- TODO: figure out questions about cocoapods and how that works

Entry 2
- Worked to refactor files into two apps to facilitate dedicating App.js to the NavigationContainer
- imported components from folder
- initilized the objects amnd tags that deal with navigation
- Needed to run this https://reactnavigation.org/docs/troubleshooting/#im-getting-an-error-unable-to-resolve-module-after-updating-to-the-latest-version to run on the simulator

- Navigator wasn't working, just rebooted and cleared cache and that did the trick

- Now quickly iterated on Registration page, able to navigate to it
